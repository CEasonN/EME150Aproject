# EME150Aproject
Reverse Engineering of a Bicycle Design
Project Prompt: For the bicycle project, please choose 2 different loading scenarios and 1
failure/fatigue scenario and analyze the critical components. To do this, please use the concepts,
theories, and equations that we learned from Chapters 3, 5, and 6. (These are the three required
chapters but you may also use information from Chapters 1 and 2 and other outside sources).
Objective: The goal is to understand whether or not these loading and fatigue scenarios are safe.
To prove whether or not a situation is safe, you could calculate a factor of safety (using different
theories) for the loading scenarios or find the number of cycles to failure for the fatigue scenario.
*Please consider using two different failure theories to find the factor of safety for one of your
loading scenarios.
Useful Parameters to include in your Methodology and Approach Section:
Handlebar diameter, Wheel inner/outer diameter, Wheel spoke diameter, Seat shaft inner/outer
diameter, Seat shaft length, diameter of the spindle, and distances between different bicycle parts.
You can list your parameters in a table format.
*Or if there are other distances that you don't know how to describe/specify, you could draw a
diagram and just label the distances you will be using in your calculations
Commonly, bicycles are made of a high-tensile steel (4130 Chromoly Normalized Alloy Steel).
It has an ultimate tensile strength of 97,200 psi and a yield strength of 63,000 psi.
But please look at the manual from your bicycle manufacturer to confirm what material your
bicycle is made of.
Sample Loading Scenarios (Axial Loading, Bending, Torsion etc.)
● Bicycle Seat
- (heavy loading on the seat post)
● Bicycle Tricks
- (wheelie, endo, stoppie, etc.)
● Handlebar
● Spokes
● Pedal
● Frames
● Braking too hard at high speeds (crash accidents)
etc.
Sample Fatigue Scenarios (Cyclic Loading)
● Crankset (Crank Arm)
● Bicycle Fork
● Frames
etc.
